# RealWorld App(Medium clone) Using Express, Sequelize and Postgre

I completed the RealWorld App project based on the [Coding Blocks's tutorial](https://cb.lk/yt/rwnodepl) and made use of [Varun Hegde's project](https://github.com/Varun-Hegde/Conduit_NodeJS) on setting up the authentication strategy.

The API documentation can be found on the https://realworld-docs.netlify.app/docs/intro
