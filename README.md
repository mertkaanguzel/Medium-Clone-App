# Medium Clone App

This app has user login and signup features and ensures the authentication before data operations. The API supports that a user can modify her/his profile, write&update& delete articles, (un)follow users, comment to articles and (un)favorite articles. The project composes of model, controller, router layers. I implemented it using **Sequelize**(Postgre) and **Express**.

I completed the RealWorld App project based on the [Coding Blocks's tutorial](https://cb.lk/yt/rwnodepl) and made use of [Varun Hegde's project](https://github.com/Varun-Hegde/Conduit_NodeJS) on setting up the authentication strategy.

The API documentation can be found on the https://realworld-docs.netlify.app/docs/specs/backend-specs/endpoints
